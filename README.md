# markov.js
Just another Markov chain library.

## API

```javascript
var markovinstance = new Markov({
  input: "What ever string or array you want... I don't care.",
  regularity: 1
});
```

Pretty simple, just create a new instance. The input is either an array of elements or a sentence, I don't care.

## Methods

### generate

```javascript
markovinstance.generate(1000);
```

Just generate a string. If you want an array, just `.split()` it. I literally don't care. The only argument is the length. Either it will generate a string that length, or it will generate till it stops. In fact, you dont have to include the argument. I... definitely don't care.

## Sample

A quality story based off of Alice in Wonderland.  
  
shouted the Queen in front of the house, and wondering what to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.
Poor Alice! It was as much as she could guess, she was now about two feet high, and was going off into a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a little house in it about four feet high. ‘Whoever lives there,’ thought Alice, ‘it’ll never do to come upon them this size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!’ So she began again: ‘Ou est ma chatte?’ which was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the room. The cook threw a frying-pan after her as she spoke. ‘I must go and get ready to play croquet with the Queen,’ and she hurried out of the wood—(she considered him to be a letter, written by the prisoner to—to somebody.’
‘It must have been that,’ said the Cat, and vanished again.
Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world am I? Ah, that’s the great puzzle!’ And she began thinking over other children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.
‘That was a narrow escape!’ said Alice, a little timidly, ‘why you are painting those roses?’
Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a great hurry.
An enormous puppy was looking down at her feet, they seemed to be no chance of this, so she began very cautiously: ‘But I don’t understand. Where did they draw the treacle from?’
‘You can draw water out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her.
‘What can all that green stuff be?’ said Alice. ‘And where have my shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can’t see you?’ She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the distant green leaves.
As there seemed to be talking in his sleep, ‘that “I breathe when I sleep” is the same thing as “I eat what I see”!’
‘You might just as well say,’ added the Dormouse, who seemed to be in a very humble tone, going down on one knee as he spoke, ‘we were trying—’
‘I see!’ said the Queen, turning purple.
‘I won’t!’ said Alice.
‘Off with her head!’ Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leave off this minute!’ She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.
There were doors all round the table, but there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and unlocking the door that led into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot high: then she walked up towards it rather timidly, saying to herself ‘That’s quite enough—I hope I shan’t grow any more—As it is, I can’t get out at the door—I do wish I hadn’t gone down that rabbit-hole—and yet—and yet—it’s rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what can have happened to me! When I used to know. Let me see: I’ll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.’
And she went on planning to herself how she would gather about her other little children, and make their eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she would manage it. ‘They must go by the carrier,’ she thought; ‘and how funny it’ll seem, sending presents to one’s own feet! And how odd the directions will look!

You wan't to know what it says? It says I dont care whether you sell it or copy it. Do what you want. Teach you cats about this code if you want. In fact, you should write the next Harry Potter with this library. Just do it.
